# Sphere

> This project is under active development. APIs may change at any time. Please use it with caution.

**Sphere** is a project template for building monolithic applications with a focus on simplicity, maintainability, and scalability. It uses `ent` for schema management and `proto` for API definitions, providing a solid foundation that can be adapted for microservices as your project evolves.

Sphere comes with powerful code generation tools to create `proto` files, `Swagger` documents, `TypeScript` clients, and
more, speeding up your development workflow.
